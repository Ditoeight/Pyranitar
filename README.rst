Pyranitar
=========

Pyranitar is cool. It can only do stuff with experience right now, but it's cool.

Version 0.3.0 - 7/27/2017
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Database builder finished and the three main tables built. To build the
database on your computer, run build_db.py and then Pyranitar.db will be created
in that tables folder. The database is just a sqlite database so realistically,
you can just use it on it's own if that's all you're interested in.

- Experience, Natures, and Pokemon tables built

- Database builder finished, turns .csv files into sqlite db

Version 0.2.2 - 7/27/2017
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Goodbye serpyrior, hello Pyranitar.

- Changed project name from serpyrior to Pyranitar


Version 0.2.1 - 7/26/2017
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Experience tables flipped around and Experience class modified to reflect those changes.

Version 0.2.0 - 7/25/2017
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Experience table and Experience class completed. You can now do some basic
calculations related to experience:

- Current level from current experience

- Distance to a level-up

- General experience to levels

Version 0.1.0 - 7/24/2017
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Initial commit - Skeletons built for the project.
