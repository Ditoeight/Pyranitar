Pyranitar
=========

Pyranitar is a Python package that provides the framework for a Pokemon object.
The idea is to make working with Pokemon in Python intuitive and easy to use,
requiring only a basic understanding of Python to start building Pokemon
related apps.

Features
--------
- A sqlite database with a ton of pokemon data
- An easy-to-use pokemon class, just pass in a dex number to get started

Installation
------------
As of right now the only way to use Pyranitar is to download or clone the
repository. Availability through PyPI in progress.
